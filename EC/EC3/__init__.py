# The package folder contains a special file called __init__.py, which stores the package's content. It serves two purposes:

#     The Python interpreter recognizes a folder as the package if it contains __init__.py file.
#     __init__.py exposes specified resources from its modules to be imported.

# An empty __init__.py file makes all functions from the above modules available when this package is imported. Note that __init__.py is essential for the folder to be recognized by Python as a package. You can optionally define functions from individual modules to be made available.

# The __init__.py file is normally kept empty. However, it can also be used to choose specific functions from modules in the package folder and make them available for import. Modify __init__.py as below:
